-> Proof of root existence with the intermediate value theorem and then finding root with the Bisection Method
-> Proof of whether a limit exists at the given point 'x' then its value at point 'f (x)'
-> Calculating the derivative of a given equation and then finding the value of f (x) at the given point 'x' (after checking whether the point is differentiable)
